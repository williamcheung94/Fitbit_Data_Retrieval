Fitbit Data Retrieval
=============
This is for getting Fitbit sensor data from users in two seperate ways:
   1) With Device and Companion API (See Javascript Companion API folder)
   2) With Web API (See Python Web API Folder)

The implementation was used on the Fitbit Ionic but can also be done one the Vitbit Versa
